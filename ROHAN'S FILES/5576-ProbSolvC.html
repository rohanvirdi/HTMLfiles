<B>Objective:</B> The objective of this course is to make the student understand programming language concepts, mainly control strucures, reading a set of data, stepwise refinement, function and arrays. After completion of this course, the student is expected to analyze the real-life problems and write the programs in C-Language to solve problems. The main emphasis of this course is on problem solving aspect.<br>
<br>
<B>Learning Outcomes:</B><br>
